==========
OO, Sheet!
==========

This module goal is to make it simple to develop OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet scripts using Python.

It's goals are to provide:

 - A good and intuitive API for most common spreadsheet routines (the design is inspired by JQuery)

 - A quick way to test your routines;

 - Simple way to embbed the script in a document and edit it later (OO.org does not);

2 minute tutorial

Open Openoffice.org Spreadsheet enabling socket connections:

  oocalc -accept="socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager"

In python shell (keep the document visible while you do that to see results in real time):

  >>> from oosheet import OOSheet as S

  Value manipulation:

  >>> S('a1').value = 10
  >>> S('b1').formula = '=a1+5'

  User events simulation:

  >>> S('b1').drag_to('g1')
  >>> S('a1:g1').drag_to('g10')
  >>> S('a1').copy() #or cut()
  >>> S('Sheet2.a1').paste()
  >>> S('a5').format_as('a1') #you need to put some formatting in a1 to make this relevant

  Date manipulation:

  >>> import datetime
  >>> S('a1').date = datetime.datetime.now() # a number will appear, you have to format it as date
  >>> S('a1').date += datetime.timedelta(5)


Hope to have more docs soon.
