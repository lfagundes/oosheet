oosheet is a module developing OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet automated routines using Python.

Documentation is available at http://oosheet.readthedocs.io/ or else, you can build it from source like this::
    
    $ easy_install Sphinx
    $ cd docs
    $ make html

then open _build/html/index.html in your web browser.

To run tests, make sure you don't have an instance of OO.org running, and then::

    $ python oosheet/tests/run_tests.py

You're supposed to be using a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution, other environments were not tested, but should work in any GNU/Linux environment.

Tests assume you have your OpenOffice.org in English - USA default language.
